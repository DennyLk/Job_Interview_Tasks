This structured HTML document sets up a webpage to display a map using OpenLayers, 
an open-source JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers. The document 
includes references to the necessary OpenLayers CSS and JavaScript files to style 
and provide functionality for the map, along with custom CSS and JavaScript files 
for further customization and interactivity. The defer attribute in the <script> 
tags ensures that the scripts are executed after the document has been parsed, 
improving page load performance.

It can be opened using a live server extension, or executing the index.html file.
